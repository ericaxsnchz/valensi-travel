- Valensi Travel displays a travel agency website that provides services for any traveler. It includes a home page, services page, and a contacting page. Throughout the site, you can use the navigation bar to navigate to different pages. On the Services page, there are links that take you to specific services on that page. For the Contact page, there is a form that can be filled out and sent. All forms are being tracked by formspree.io.
- I used Visual Studio Code for this project, specifically .html and .css.
- For future improvement:
  - creating more realistic classes for each element instead of having an overflow of unnecessary items
  - the navbar can be on the service page is different compared to the others. I would want to better improve my knowledge on navbars and    
    making sure there aren't any issues.
  - having a variety of color schemes/themes to base the design of the site. The final layout is completely different from the original.
